## About Me

I help startup and growth teams turn messy, scattered data into clear, decision-ready dashboards that reduce costs, improve performance, and uncover growth opportunities.

Over the last few years, I’ve supported teams at Excelerate, Lloyd’s Banking Group, and Accenture - building reporting systems, analyzing customer behavior, and delivering insights that leaders actually use.

What I help teams do:

- Eliminate manual Excel reporting
- Build Power BI & Tableau dashboards for leadership
- Understand customer behavior & churn
- Track revenue, costs, and product performance
- Turn raw data into actionable business decisions

If you’re a founder, operations lead, or growth manager who wants better visibility into your business, send me a message - I’ll be happy to review your current reporting setup and suggest improvements.

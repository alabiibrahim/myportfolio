## About Me

I help startup teams analyze their data to see what’s working, what’s wasting money and where to grow. Data isn't just about numbers but turning the numbers into smart decisions your business will need **RIGHT NOW**!

- I helped a technology company (**Excelerate**) saves 18% cost by analyzing their data and identifying an underperfomring Ad Campaign. 

- I helped a social media client at **Accenture** clean, modeled and analyzed 7 datasets to uncover insights into content trends to make strategic decision that saved him from high cost of failure.
  
- I built a custom dashboard for a client who doesn't have time. Now, he can tell what and what is going on with his business everyweek. 

- I’ve built analytical solutions that help businesses make smarter decisions and also worked on variety of projects.

I specialize in Turning Data into Insightful Decisions, Database Design, Data Modeling, Dashboard Design/ Visualization, Insights that drive action. I'm continuously learning and love transforming messy data into beautiful, actionable visuals. WIth 2 years of experience.
